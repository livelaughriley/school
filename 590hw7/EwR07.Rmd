# Problem Introduction

The data set **nbasal** contains salary information and career statistics for 269 players in the National Basketball Association (NBA).


# Part (i)

Estimate a model relating points-per-game ($points$) to years in the league ($exper$), $age$, and years played in college ($coll$). Include a quadratic in $exper$; the other variables should appear in level form. Report the results in the usual way.


# Part (ii)

Holding college years and age fixed, at what value of experience does the next year of experience actually reduce points-per-game? Does this make sense?


# Part (iii)

Why do you think $coll$ has a negative and statistically significant coefficient? (*Hint*: NBA players can be drafted before finishing their college careers and even directly out of high
school.)


# Part (iv)

Add a quadratic in $age$ to the equation. Is it needed? What does this appear to imply about the effects of age, once experience and education are controlled for?


# Part (v)

Now regress $\log(wage)$ on $points$, $exper$, $exper^2$, $age$, and $coll$. Report the results in the usual format.


# part (vi)

Test whether $age$ and $coll$ are jointly significant in the regression from part (v). What does this imply about whether age and education have separate effects on wage, once productivity and
seniority are accounted for?
